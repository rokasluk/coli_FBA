## Summary
This is a compilation of Jupyter notebook files used to perform metabolic engineering on E.coli MG1655 metabolic model (iJO1366) to perform synthesis of beta-carotene.
Besides the IPYNBs, a folder containing the two versions of metabolic models used: the base iJO1366, that can be found on bigg.ucsd.edu, and an edited iJO1366 with the Mevalonate (MEV) pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both versions also contain the beta-carotene synthesis genes, that are not part of native E.coli metabolism.
