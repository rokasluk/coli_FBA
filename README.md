## Summary
This is a compilation of Jupyter notebook files used to perform metabolic engineering on E.coli MG1655 metabolic model (iJO1366) modified to perform synthesis of beta-carotene. The aim was to improve the production of the metabolite through gene knockout frameworks and identification of gene expression modulation targets both supplied by the cameo ([link] https://github.com/biosustain/cameo)
Besides the IPYNBs, a folder containing the two versions of metabolic models used: the base `iJO1366`, that can be found on bigg.ucsd.edu, and an edited iJO1366 with the Mevalonate (MEV) pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (`iJO1366_MEV`). Both versions also contain the beta-carotene synthesis genes, that are not part of native E.coli metabolism.

Hopefully having these examples will be of some help to others working with cameo and cobrapy.
